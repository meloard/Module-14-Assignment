# Module-14-Assignment
Module 14 Assignment - Tech Blog (MVC)

# Tech B;og - MVC

## Description

In this challenge we were tasked with building a full-stack Tech Blog application, that allows users to create accounts, and post comments on the page. The back end of this assignment was built usins MYSQL, and the front-end deployed with handlebars. This assignment was quick challenging and required many folders and documents to build out, but it taught me a lot about file structure, and where data is being routed from front to the back end.
